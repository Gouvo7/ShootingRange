A complex application for the purposes of a local shooting range facility

This application was designed to be used by a local shooting range facility. It's been built using C# and the purposes of the project are:

1) Sign up new club members.
2) Manage and track the club's storage (weapons, ammunition, etc).
3) Fill out forms of the scores from practices and competitions.
4) Export PDF files destined for the Greek police enforcement.

I built this application because all of the club's documents were saved only on paper, nothing was digital.
(P.S. This is a brief of the original application, the main project's code cannot be shared.)
